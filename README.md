## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use React, Redux, TypeScript, [Mantine Library](https://mantine.dev),and OpenWeatherMap API.

Furthermore, this project also demonstrates how to deploy the web app, and has some test cases.

## Prerequisites

1. To have Node.js 12 or higher installed, and to have the [`npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) command installed.
2. [OpenCageData](opencagedata.com) API Key
3. [OpenWeatherMap](openweathermap.org) API Key

## Local development

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/kingdevil731/open-weather-app.git`
- Install npm package: `npm i` or `yarn install`
- Rename the .env.example to .env, and put your [OpenCageData API key](https://opencagedata.co/) and OpenWeatherMap API key into the .env file.
- For bundling frontend code run `npm run build`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
